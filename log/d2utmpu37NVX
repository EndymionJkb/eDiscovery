    %p Pittsburgh is one of the international centers for computer learning and artificial intelligence and a natural location for Review LessSM to be headquartered.  We have extensive relationships within the Carnegie Mellon University community and leverage these relationships to enable us to better understand the technology options for making review more efficient enabling corporations to Review LessSM and Get More relevant ESI for their effort.
    %p Examples of Pittsburghs stature in the world community of artificial intelligence are many.  The only Nobel Peace Prize winner for Decision Learning, the building blocks for Artificial Intelligence was Herb Simon, who spent most of his professional career teaching at what is now Carnegie Mellon University where he worked with another prestigious artificial intelligence pioneer Allen Newell.  Carnegie Mellon University is frequently ranked as one of the top Artificial Intelligence programs in the United States and the world.  The National Science Foundation which sponsors the prestigious TREC program that has provided the legal community with many of the best best bench mark examples of how to improve search and retrieval, also consistently provides Carnegie Mellon University with either the most or 2nd most grants of any other school for Information Retrieval research from 2006  2009.  Over $400 million has been donated in this time frame.  
    %p Pittsburgh just hosted the DESI IV section of the ICAIL conference, the leading technical workshop on electronic discovery which was organized by Jason Baron, Laura Ellsworth, David Lewis, Deba Logan and Douglas Oard.  The first three host cities of this unique event were Palo Alto, CA, London, England and Barcelona, Spain.   
    %p There are also a number of world famous computer scientists who currently work in Pittsburgh including:
    %ul
      %li 
        Eric Nyberg from the Language Technologies Institute, School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University and was one of the project leaders on the team which developed IBMs Watson computer.
      %li
        Professor Jaime Carbonell who is the Allen Newell Professor of Computer Science and the director of the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.
      %li
        Dr. Kevin Ashley holds interdisciplinary appointments as a faculty member of the Graduate Program in Intelligent Systems at the University of Pittsburgh, a Senior Scientist at the Learning Research and Development Center, a Professor of Law, and Adjunct Professor of Computer Science where he focuses on research on artificial intelligence and information retrieval in areas that impact law.
    %p So locating Review Less in Pittsburgh is a natural decision and one which we believe that even Watson, the super computer would agree with.):

      %p Finding electronically stored information (ESI) is the most expensive part of litigation or an investigation.  Review Less has been a pioneer to reduce the costs of document review work through predictive coding including serving as experts in the landmark case Global Aerospace v. Landow Aviation and developing ReviewRight, technology assisted recruiting to identify qualified, document review attorneys for less cost.  As expert witnesses we enable law firms and corporations to defend their use of technology to find relevant ESI efficiently and accurately, and provide tested and screened document reviewers to do the document review work who we will employ at review rates most agencies find impossible to match.   
      %p Our services also include offering vendor neutral education and consulting about predictive coding or technology assisted review, we are predictive coding resellers of a complete tool kit of analytical solutions to accomplish predictive coding results, and we offer a unique methodology to recruit, employ, and improve the quality of your review team.

      %br/
      %p The biggest challenge in review is not finding lawyers to do the review.  There are an abundance of attorneys available at law firms, for temporary assignments, or offshore.  The challenge is determining whether an attorney is suitable and skilled in doing document review and then training and managing them.  
      %p Review skill is not measurable from a resume and hard to verify in an interview.  Reference checking is useful but hard to access the project managers who might really know if a reviewer does an accurate and timely job with document review work.  Yet this is how virtually every document review attorney is selected for assignments.
      %p The most accurate and unbiased way to assess a reviewers ability to do document review work is to actually test the candidate for their ability before putting them on a project.  Review Right was created with this objective in mind and has been used successfully in legal markets across the United States.  Testing reduces the costs for recruiting, the costs of putting several poor reviewers on a project and having to fix their work, and is a step towards making review a professional legal skill viewed as important to legal organizations as writing, oral advocacy, and substantive knowledge of a particular area of law.  It also provides a foundation to defend predictive coding results.
      %p By creating a process of technology assisted recruiting, Review Right is able to find and employ contract attorneys for a gross margin of only $4.50 an hour above the payment to the reviewing attorneys in most markets.  We are not publicly traded, we do not over compensate our recruiters, there are no layers of management requiring a cut of the fee, and overhead is kept to a minimum.  Our data driven approach also provides our clients with important metrics to defend predictive coding as expert witnesses in addition to cost savings and enhanced quality.
      %p== #{link_to "Contact", contact_path} Review Right to learn more about testing review attorneys and creating better document review teams.  Review Right also offers pay rolling services for review teams, review space, review training and review communication tools for review teams across the United States.
