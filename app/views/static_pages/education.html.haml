      %p Back in 2010, the barrier to using predictive coding was defensibility.  What would judges say if lawyers used these tools to find ESI in a case?  We have been leaders in judicial technology education since that time to understand the validity of those concerns.  in April 2012, we had the opportunity to leverage this experience and assist a client in making the first defensibility argument to a court that enabled our client to use predictive coding over the objection of the other party.  This case, Global Aerospace v. Landow Aviation, showed our understanding from training judges was correct.  That a court would accept the data available on costly linear review and academic statistics about the efficiency of predictive coding approaches and allow predictive coding.  As a result, our clients were able to hit all deadlines and moved completely away from guessing at key words to find potentially responsive documents.  We didn't get all the national predictive coding headlines in Global Aerospace, but we were able to successfully complete the project within the court imposed deadlines in a high profile case achieving dramatic client savings.
      %p After numerous discussions with companies, law firms and vendors and extensive surveying of companies experimenting using predictive coding, we have identified education of outside law firms and companies as the single greatest barrier to widespread adoption of predictive coding.  As a result, we offer vendor neutral predictive coding training to the legal community on how to move beyond simple linear review steps into more complex predictive coding workflows and to share independent predictive coding research across vendors compiled with the EDiscovery Journal.
