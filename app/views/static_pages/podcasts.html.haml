      %p== Through #{link_to 'ESIBytes', 'http://ESIBytes.com', :target => '_blank'}, we have created the largest library of free education on predictive coding in the industry. Listen to these shows with guests we hand invited to discuss issues we identified as worth doing podcasts on in the field of predictive coding.
